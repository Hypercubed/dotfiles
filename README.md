# Hypercubed dotfiles

## dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://gist.github.com/fdd6c82e7c877b09c84b.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./init.sh
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.
