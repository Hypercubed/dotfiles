# Hypercubed dotfiles

## dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## Install

Run this:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Hypercubed/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
./dotfiles/bin/init.sh
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.

## Inspiration

Based on (not forked from) https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/ and https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles.
